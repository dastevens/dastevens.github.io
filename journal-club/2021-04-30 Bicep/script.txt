Azure bicep (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/bicep-overview) is Microsoft's domain specific language and tooling for infrastructure as code. It is a great improvement on ARM templates, which are big balls of json. There are a number of advantages, for instance the bicep language is much more succinct than ARM. You only need to define the parameters that matter to you. To help authoring, there is a VSCode extension that provides syntactic highlighting and contextual help. And you can define re-usable modules that have input and output parameters.

When you deploy a template, behind the scenes the template is transpiled into ARM json. It is also possible to decompile ARM json templates into bicep with some limitations. Deploying is achieved using the az cli (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/bicep-tutorial-create-first-bicep?tabs=azure-cli#deploy-bicep-file).

Bicep is currently in preview v0.3.255, but it was actively promoted by microsoft at its ignite event in March. If you want some more introductory information, I would recommend this 30 minute video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc1kJfcRQgY).
