CICD for github to windows service in SCADA zone

- Analysis of current state/desired state
    - Deployments took a long time
    - Server installs not consistent (messy)
    - No audit trail
    - Difficult to discover what is installed where

- Looked at some options, but none met the requirements
    - Squirrel
    - Chocolatey
    - Google chrome update service

- Decided to roll my own
    - 2 stage publish/deploy paradigm
        - Publish = Make available for deployment
        - Deploy = Install ready for execution
    - Publish to ArtefactStore
    - Deploy with UpdateService

- pack-man/smart-edge-packages

    - artefact store
        - versioned zip archives organized into packages
        - Artefact.json describes zip archives
        - Dependencies allow enable of config files

    - pack-man
        - A simple package manager
        - zips up a folder and labels it with semver => an artefact
        - extracts an artefact to a folder
        - installs an artefact and its dependencies to a folder

    - smart-edge-packages
        - version controlled package repository
        - all package changes are peer reviewed
        - audit trail
        - PRs can show changes to several different instances
        - can change config without making a new binary package (build)

- Demo of UpdateService installing RES.Security.Console
